# 18. Absorption Spectrum Calculations for bulk systems using LDA+RPA, LDA+rt-TDDFT, HSE+rt-TDDFT methods

## 简介

This module is used to introduce how to calculate optical absorption spectrum for bulk systems using LAD+RPA (random phase approximation), LDA+rt-TDDFT and HSE (RSE)+rt-TDDFT methods. PWmat can run the range separated hybrid (RSH, also called it HSE in PWmat) function with HSE_alpha, HSE_omega, HSE_beta parameters, representing short range mixing (HSE_alpha) and long range mixing (HSE_beta), as well as the transition position (HSE_omega, optimally tuned functional). The RSH can describe the long range dielectric screening with HSE_beta, it is thus believed it can describe the correct Coulomb interaction in electron-hole interaction.（周期性体系计算光吸收谱的几种方法，RPA/tddft/tddft+hse））
