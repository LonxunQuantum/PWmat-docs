# Q-Studio

Q-Studio is an atomic-scale materials modeling application designed to assist users in pre-computation structural preparation. Q-Studio supports the modeling of small molecules, crystals, nanoclusters, disordered structures, heterostructures, transition state structures, quantum transport devices, etc., and can export models to Q-Flow structure libraries or locally. Visit [Mcloud: Longxun Supercomputing Cloud Platform](https://mcloud.lonxun.com/), click the Q-Studio icon to open the application, and start the material modeling work.
