# symmetry
For periodic structures, symmetry can be canceled, symmetry can be found, lattice transformations can be carried out to generate Brillouin zone paths, and the structure of some spatial groups can also undergo protocell-inertial cell conversion.

- Cancel symmetry: i.e. the Make P1 operation sets the space group of the periodic structure to P1 (1)

- Protocell inertial cell conversion: The structure of the first letter of the space group name is 'I', 'F', 'C', which can be converted between protocell and inertial cell, and if it is a rhomboid (triangular) crystal system, it also needs to meet a=b>c
