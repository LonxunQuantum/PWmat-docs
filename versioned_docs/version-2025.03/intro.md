**Q-CAD** is a Material Design R&D integration platform developed by [Longxun](http://www.pwmat.com/).

:::tip NOTE
Under the background of carbon peaking, carbon neutrality, the rapid development of the biomedical industry and the imminent end of Moore's Law, the traditional industrial design CAD software based on continuous mediaand Newtonian mechanics can no longer meet the research and development needs of related industries, and it is necessary to take into account more microscopic quantum effects. LongXun thus proposed the concept of Q-CAD (Quantum-Computer Aided Design), adding modules that can calculate quantum effects to industrial design software, creating atomic-scale material design software in the post-industrial era, innovating the traditional material research and development model, and changing the face of industrial design and manufacturing.
